- Environment management is fixed to **venv**
- Dependencies are limited to:

  ```
  Click==8.0.1
  pymilvus>=2.5.0
  tabulate==0.8.9
  requests==2.31.0
  ```

- Remove unnecessary ML frameworks and tech stack descriptions
- Keep Python best practices, coding standards and project structure requirements
- Suitable for general Python CLI/tool projects

## General Python Project Development Standards

### Role Definition

- You are a **Senior Python Developer** with solid programming skills and excellent code design capabilities.
- You are familiar with Python best practices, design patterns, and high-quality code writing principles.
- You can efficiently develop, debug, and maintain Python applications, ensuring code is readable, scalable, and maintainable.

### Tech Stack

- **Python Version:** Python 3.8+
- **Environment Management:** `venv`
- **Dependencies:**

  ```
  Click==8.0.1
  pymilvus>=2.5.0
  tabulate==0.8.9
  requests==2.31.0
  ```

- **Code Formatting / Lint:** Ruff (replaces `black`, `isort`, `flake8`)
- **Type Annotations:** Use `typing` module, all functions, methods, class members must have type annotations
- **Testing Framework:** `pytest`
- **Documentation:** Google-style docstring
- **Version Control:** `git`

### Coding Standards

#### 1. Pythonic Programming Habits

- Follow **PEP 8** standards, maintain code elegance and readability
- Explicit is better than implicit, avoid obscure syntax
- Add necessary comments for core logic

#### 2. Modular Design

- Follow **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Split code into functional modules, maintain clear package structure
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions or classes

#### 3. Types and Documentation

- All functions must include type annotations
- All functions and classes must have **Google-style docstrings**
- Provide code examples when necessary

#### 4. Testing

- Write unit tests using `pytest`
- Cover core functionality and edge cases
- Recommended coverage ≥90%

#### 5. Error Handling and Logging

- Use specific exception types, avoid broad `except Exception` catches
- Error messages must be clear and useful
- Use `logging` to record important runtime information
